```
$hello -> Says Hello

$bye -> Says Bye

$ping -> Returns Bot Latency in miliseconds

$notes -> Shows list of saved notes

$save <note name> -> Saves the mentioned menssage with provided name to be retreived later

$get <note name> -> Retreives to queried note

$shorten <url1> <url2> ... -> Shortens provided urls with tinyurl

$help -> Shows this help message

(More Coming Soon)
